RubyGems Home
=============

Place for Ruby gems installed by the current user. GEM_HOME environment
variable has to point to this directory. Remember that you have to require
rubygems first. It can be done automatically by setting RUBYOPT environment
variable to "-rubygems".

Makefile is used to generate the tags file for installed gems, it can be used
for example in Vim after set tags+="$HOME/.gems/tags".
